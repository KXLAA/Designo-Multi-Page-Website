## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Your Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"

## My process

### Built with

- [React Responsive](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-responsive)
- [Formik](https://formik.org/) & [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) for form & form validation
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

This is my first project with Next, I learnt a lot about the NPM ecosystem and how to read documentation as I used a number of helper libraries in the project. I struggled a bit with making the website responsive due to the number of layout shifts and absolutely positioned elements. I used the react responsive package to handle some of those elements.
